# EOMP-JAVASCRIPT
Please See:
  * product.js: - lines 1 to 18
                - lines 103 to 109
                - lines 229 to 235

  * style.css: - lines 120 to 133

  * checkout.js: - lines 29 to 31


Note: You can use the EXACT same code in your admin.js as was added in the checkout.js
      The only difference will be that, instead of using:
        "let checkoutList = JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem('checkout items') )"
      Use:
        "let checkoutList = JSON.parse( localStorage.getItem('products') )"







<!-- I am to setup the Local storage as of yet.
=================================================
The Checkout.js has to be set correct.
=================================================
The Admin.js needs to be touched up.
=================================================
The pulling and writing of product info must be done.
=================================================
The filter & sort should be added.
=================================================
Price Calculation and Quantity * Price = Total must be done.
=================================================
Might need some style TLC.
================================================= -->
